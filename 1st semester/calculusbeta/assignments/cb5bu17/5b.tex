\subsection{a} 

Finding the partial derivatives by differentiating with respect to x and y respectively

\[
f_{x} = 6x^2-24
.\] 
and

\[
f_{y} = 2y-6
.\] 


\subsection{b}

since the objective is to find critical points the gradient must be $\nabla f(x,y) = (0, 0)$ which results in 2 equations with 2 unknown variables
\begin{align*}
	6x^2-24&=0\\ 2y-6&=0
.\end{align*}
